# MCM Report Template

This is my team's LaTeX template for the COMAP Mathematical Modeling Contest (MCM/ICM) that we have used for the past several years. 

## Usage
To use this template, do one of the following:
- Import the repository into Overleaf and compile the `main.tex` file
- Edit and compile the `main.tex` file locally through a latex editor

Once a problem is chosen, make sure to update the **Team Number** and **Problem Choice** values at the top of the file, and this will update the values in all the necessary places in the file.
